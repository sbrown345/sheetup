= Real World Ideas =
==Fun==
  # Animate toggling stylesheets. Styles that can't be animated could perhaps fade out, switch and fade back in. Have some sample ones
    * Different width columns, diferent colours.
    * Different background image, things floated differently. - Fade these bits in/out. E.g. A div of a diferent size and background image will fade to transparent, swap image, and then fade back in while still changing size. 
  # Interactive zen garden type thing. Allows user to save back to page.
  # Have animation settings in a style sheet as a diffirent class. E.g. what a menu looks like when it has dropped down. jQuery or something else can be used to animate through to these.

==Useful==
  # In-browser HTML template editor
  # Easy customisation of webpages. E.g. definable menu width. Set width of content etc - could save with cookie .
