# Real World Ideas #
## Fun ##
  1. Animate toggling stylesheets. Styles that can't be animated could perhaps fade out, switch and fade back in. Have some sample ones
    * Different width columns, diferent colours.
    * Different background image, things floated differently. - Fade these bits in/out. E.g. A div of a diferent size and background image will fade to transparent, swap image, and then fade back in while still changing size.
  1. Interactive zen garden type thing. Allows user to save back to page.
  1. Have animation settings in a style sheet as a diffirent class. E.g. what a menu looks like when it has dropped down. jQuery or something else can be used to animate through to these.

## Useful ##
  1. In-browser HTML template editor
  1. Easy customisation of webpages. E.g. definable menu width. Set width of content etc - could save with cookie .
